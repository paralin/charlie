 - Add concept of "master keypairs" or trusted "commanders" - people
   issuing commands.
 - "server keypairs" or "trusted relay keypairs" are the C&C server keys
   that the client will trust. The idea here is to have one keypair for
   every trusted server, but not to actually trust the servers
   themselves for commands, but the person sending the commands.
